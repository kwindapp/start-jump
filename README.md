- Test Device Lilygo T-Echo with ?? ,Gravity BMX160 + BMP388 10 DOF Sensor,MPU-9250 ,BNO055 (9-DOF Absolute Orientation Sensor),??
- BMP388 + IMU (MPU6886 or BMX160) is arguably the best combo for kitesurf jump tracking. You get high-accuracy jump height, real-time airtime, and trick detection ‚Äî all in a lightweight, wearable setup.
- Detect Takeoff using IMU:

Spike in upward Z-acceleration ‚Üí takeoff timestamp.

Start recording altitude with BMP388:

Continue until Z-acceleration spike again (landing).

Record peak altitude:

BMP388 gives you height above takeoff point.

Calculate Airtime:

Difference between takeoff and landing timestamps.

Optional: Use gyroscope/magnetometer to detect rotations or spins.

Main Topic: Jump Recording with IMU on a Kiteboard Using LoRaWAN & E-Paper Display
Objective:
To record and display jump data (height, airtime, and impact acceleration) on an E-paper display attached to a kiteboard. The data, along with GPS coordinates, will also be sent via LoRaWAN for remote tracking and retrieval.

System Components:
ESP32 (LoRaWAN-enabled) ‚Äì To handle processing, communication, and connectivity.

IMU (MPU6886 or similar) ‚Äì To capture acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity for jump data.

GPS Module ‚Äì To track the real-time location of the kiteboard.

LoRaWAN Module ‚Äì To transmit data over long distances (e.g., via a LoRa gateway to a cloud server).

E-paper Display ‚Äì For displaying real-time data on the kiteboard in outdoor conditions.....NO REFLECTIONS SUNLIGHT!!!

Battery ‚Äì For powering the system.

How It Works:
IMU Data for Jump Recording: 

FLEXIBLE HARDWARE IMU CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE ESP32 BOARDS IMU SENSOR HARDWARE OF OUR CHOICE !!üëç

CODE WITH SMART AI ......PARAMETER MENU FINE TUNING  üòâ !!! FIRMWARE UPDATES OVER KWIND WEBFLASHER HOMEPAGE

The IMU detects changes in acceleration and orientation when the kiteboard is in motion.

During a jump, the IMU records:

Takeoff acceleration: When the board leaves the ground.

Airtime: The time spent in the air (derived from the IMU's acceleration data).

Impact acceleration: When landing, showing the impact force on the board.

Jump height: Calculated based on the airtime and vertical acceleration.

GPS for Real-Time Location:   ALSO FOR FIND MY KITEBOARD !!!!!  üòÅüòÅ   

The GPS module continuously records the latitude and longitude of the kiteboard.

GPS data is used to show the location of the board on the E-paper display.

LoRaWAN for Data Transmission:

Once a jump is detected and the session is complete, the jump data (height, airtime, impact acceleration) and GPS coordinates are sent via LoRaWAN to a remote station or cloud server for storage and tracking.

This data can be retrieved later for analysis or real-time monitoring.

E-paper Display:    LOW POWER CONSUME NO REFLECTIONS SUNLIGHT !!!üòé

The E-paper display shows:

Jump height (cm) ‚Äì The maximum height reached during the jump.

Airtime (s) ‚Äì The duration of the jump.

Impact acceleration (g) ‚Äì The force experienced upon landing.

Location (GPS coordinates) ‚Äì The current position of the kiteboard.

The display updates dynamically after each jump, providing live performance data while the user is on the water.

1. BMP388 or BMP390 + BMX160 (IMU)
What you get: Jump height, airtime, 3D orientation

Why it‚Äôs great: Fast, lightweight, and super accurate

Use case: Action sports, wearables

üîπ 2. BMX160 + BMP390 + GPS (like u-blox NEO-M9N)
GPS adds:

Horizontal speed

Jump distance

Position logging (spots, sessions)

Optionally: sync with GoPro footage

BMP390 is slightly more stable and accurate than BMP388.

üß† Fusion of IMU + GPS velocity + BMP altitude = extremely solid jump profiles.

üîπ 3. Add UWB (Ultra-Wideband) or Time-of-Flight (ToF)
If you're looking for elite-level precision ‚Äî like <10 cm vertical tracking and real-time feedback ‚Äî consider:

UWB (e.g. DWM1001):

Can give precise 3D positioning in a defined area (you‚Äôd need base stations on the beach or boat).

Works great in competitions or training environments.

ToF Sensors (e.g. VL53L1X):

Short range (up to ~4m), but instant vertical distance to water.

Useful if mounted on the board or waist looking down.

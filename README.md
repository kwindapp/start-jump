Main Topic: Jump Recording with IMU on a Kiteboard Using LoRaWAN & E-Paper Display
Objective:
To record and display jump data (height, airtime, and impact acceleration) on an E-paper display attached to a kiteboard. The data, along with GPS coordinates, will also be sent via LoRaWAN for remote tracking and retrieval.

System Components:
ESP32 (LoRaWAN-enabled) ‚Äì To handle processing, communication, and connectivity.

IMU (MPU6886 or similar) ‚Äì To capture acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity for jump data.

GPS Module ‚Äì To track the real-time location of the kiteboard.

LoRaWAN Module ‚Äì To transmit data over long distances (e.g., via a LoRa gateway to a cloud server).

E-paper Display ‚Äì For displaying real-time data on the kiteboard in outdoor conditions.....NO REFLECTIONS SUNLIGHT!!!

Battery ‚Äì For powering the system.

How It Works:
IMU Data for Jump Recording: CODE WITH SMART AI ......PARAMETERS MENU FINE TUNING  üòâ !!!

The IMU detects changes in acceleration and orientation when the kiteboard is in motion.

During a jump, the IMU records:

Takeoff acceleration: When the board leaves the ground.

Airtime: The time spent in the air (derived from the IMU's acceleration data).

Impact acceleration: When landing, showing the impact force on the board.

Jump height: Calculated based on the airtime and vertical acceleration.

GPS for Real-Time Location:   ALSO FOR FIND MY KITEBOARD !!!!!  üòÅüòÅ   

The GPS module continuously records the latitude and longitude of the kiteboard.

GPS data is used to show the location of the board on the E-paper display.

LoRaWAN for Data Transmission:

Once a jump is detected and the session is complete, the jump data (height, airtime, impact acceleration) and GPS coordinates are sent via LoRaWAN to a remote station or cloud server for storage and tracking.

This data can be retrieved later for analysis or real-time monitoring.

E-paper Display:    LOW POWER CONSUME NO REFLECTIONS SUNLIGHT !!!üòé

The E-paper display shows:

Jump height (cm) ‚Äì The maximum height reached during the jump.

Airtime (s) ‚Äì The duration of the jump.

Impact acceleration (g) ‚Äì The force experienced upon landing.

Location (GPS coordinates) ‚Äì The current position of the kiteboard.

The display updates dynamically after each jump, providing live performance data while the user is on the water.
